### **Project Structure and Components**

1. **Main Entry Point (`index.js`):**  
   - **Server Initialization:**  
     - The `index.js` file acts as the primary entry point for the application. It sets up the server, configures middleware, and defines the routing logic.  
     - Utilizes the **Express.js** framework to streamline server and routing functionalities.  
   - **Middleware Configuration:**  
     - Implements middleware for parsing JSON payloads, handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), and managing static files.  
   - **Routing:**  
     - Directs incoming HTTP requests to appropriate route handlers based on the request URL and method.  
     - Modularizes routes by delegating specific paths to dedicated router modules located in the `app` directory.  

2. **Application Directory (`app/`):**  
   - **Controllers:**  
     - Contains functions that process incoming requests, interact with the database, and formulate responses.  
     - Implements business logic for various operations, such as user authentication, note management, and collaboration features.  
   - **Models:**  
     - Defines the data schema and interfaces for interacting with the database.  
     - Utilizes **Mongoose** for modeling application data and enforcing data validation.  
   - **Routes:**  
     - Houses route definitions that map HTTP endpoints to corresponding controller functions.  
     - Organizes routes based on functionality, enhancing code maintainability and readability.  
   - **Utilities:**  
     - Includes helper functions and modules that support common tasks like error handling, logging, and configuration management.  

3. **Configuration Files:**  
   - **`package.json`:**  
     - Lists project dependencies, scripts, and metadata.  
     - Manages versioning and facilitates package installation.  
   - **`.gitignore`:**  
     - Specifies files and directories to be excluded from version control, such as `node_modules/` and environment variables files.  
   - **`README.md`:**  
     - Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.  
     - Serves as a reference for developers and contributors.

### **Key Features and Functionalities**

- **User Authentication and Authorization:**  
  - Implements secure user registration and login mechanisms using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for session management.  
  - Enforces role-based access control to restrict functionalities based on user permissions.  

- **Note Management:**  
  - Enables users to create, read, update, and delete notes.  
  - Supports rich text formatting and tagging for better organization.  

- **Collaboration Tools:**  
  - Allows multiple users to share and collaboratively edit notes in real-time.  
  - Integrates WebSocket communication for live updates and synchronization.  

- **Search and Filtering:**  
  - Implements full-text search capabilities to quickly locate notes based on keywords.  
  - Provides filtering options by tags, date, and collaborators.  

- **Scalability and Performance:**  
  - Utilizes **asynchronous programming** patterns to handle concurrent requests efficiently.  
  - Implements caching strategies to reduce database load and improve response times.  

- **Security Measures:**  
  - Employs input validation and sanitization to prevent **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks.  
  - Uses environment variables to manage sensitive configurations securely.

### **Technologies and Tools Utilized**

- **Node.js:**  
  - Serves as the runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side.  
  - Provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture suitable for scalable applications.  

- **Express.js:**  
  - A minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and middleware integration.  
  - Facilitates rapid development of robust APIs.  

- **MongoDB with Mongoose:**  
  - **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.  
  - **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, providing schema-based data modeling and validation.  

- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):**  
  - A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.  
  - Used for securely transmitting information for authentication and authorization purposes.  

- **Nodemon:**  
  - A development utility that automatically restarts the server upon detecting file changes.  
  - Enhances development workflow efficiency.

### **Setup and Installation**

To set up the Algorian-Backend project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Surbhi-sinha/Algorian-Backend.git
   cd Algorian-Backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Ensure that **Node.js** and **npm** are installed on your machine. Then, run:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define necessary environment variables, such as database connection strings and JWT secret keys. Refer to `.env.example` for guidance.

4. **Start the Server:**  
   For development purposes, use:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command utilizes **Nodemon** to monitor for file changes and automatically restarts the server.

5. **Access the Application:**  
   The backend server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`. You can use tools like **Postman** to interact with the API endpoints.
